# TensorFlowKerasIntro
Scripts to practice the basics of TensorFlow and Keras while building networks for image classification on the CIFAR (3 RGB channels) and MNIST (1 grayscale channel) image datasets. 

-  Deep_CIFAR_KerasModel.py: CNN model (with grid search over hyper parameters) built with the Keras Model API applied on the CIFAR dataset.
-  Deep_CIFAR_LayersEstimators.py: CNN model built using tf.layers and the TF Estimator API applied on the CIFAR dataset.
-  Deep_CIFAR_LayersSession.py: CNN model built with tf.layers and tf.Session applied on the CIFAR dataset.
-  Deep_MNIST_TFcore.py: CNN model built with low-level TF API and tf.Session applied on the MNIST dataset.
